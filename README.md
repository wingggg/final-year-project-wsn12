# final-year-project-wsn12-2016

This README contains information about the codes submitted to this repository.
Below are directory names followed by a brief description of the files inside.
Note that 	"data" contains files and libraries built for Linux
			"data_pi" contains files and libraries built for Raspbian

			
background_test_benchmark:
	Text files containing manually defined benchmarking results for 33 sub-datasets, 
	and an additional benchmarkAll.txt file containing the concatenated contents of these 33 text files.
	
matlab_test:
	findRegion.m		function that takes background_subtraction output bounding box dimensions and works out what regions it lies in using a look-up-table for the 9-square grid.
	testAllDatasets.m	test file that takes background_subtraction output and benchmarking file, returns an output file with percentage accuracies.
	testDataset.m		function that takes background_subtraction output as argument and benchmarking file from path, returns percentage accuracies.
	test.m				top-level test file for multiple input files
	testResultsAll.txt	an example output file generated by testAllDatasets.m on testAll.txt
	
data:
	bcode/
		runall.sh					shell script file to compile and run background_subtraction and git add
	bcode/bin/
		textAll.txt					test image paths for 33 data-subsets
		outputAll.txt				returned by background_subtraction as results from textAll.txt
		background_subtraction.ln	background_subtraction executable file
	bcode/bin/datasets
		<subset name>.txt			test image paths for named data-subset
		<subset name>_out.txt		returned by background_subtraction as results from <subset name>.txt

data_pi:
	bcode/
		runall.sh					shell script file to compile and run background_subtraction and git add
	bcode/test/

	lib/							libraries for background_subtraction built for Raspbian
	
	lib/exec/background_subtraction/code_versions
		background_subtraction_original.cpp			original working source code copied from "data" (not working for Raspbian)
		background_subtraction_before_opt.cpp		working source code for Raspbian
