This directory contains code for detecting SIFT keys in images.

Following finds SIFT keys in a Vista image, and outputs a file
with the image overlayed with keys:

% sift <../images/cafe.v >result.v


Some parameters that can be changed (change in code)
-----------------------------------

Set DoubleImSize = TRUE in key.c to find 4 times as many SIFT keys.
  This doubles the image size first before processing, effectively
  doubling image resolution.

KeyDisplaySize = 0.4.  This can be increased or decreased to change
  the output size of each key square.
